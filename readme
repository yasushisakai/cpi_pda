use tags to go through the process of using cpis through pda's. See test first to know what each tag is trying to do.
	
- tag '000_no_pda_nor_cpi'

  Simple 'worker'. Nothing should be surprising here.

- tag '001_cpi_without_pda'

  The 'increment' function gets executed by the manager program

- tag '002_cpi_without_pda_authority'

  Added authority field to limit who can increment. Since it's the keypair is used through both programs this is unlikely useable.

- tag '003_cpi_pda_authority'

  'Increment' function gets signed by the PDA through CPI.
